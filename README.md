# Needle detection
PROJECT IN PROGRESS

The aim of the project is to create an application that will extract and color the needle from USG film.

# First step
## Application Example
Click to watch!

[![StayFit](https://github.com/tobiaszmateusz/Needle-detection/blob/main/photos/2.png)](https://youtu.be/WEW8iWGmpjs "Click to watch!")

At this stage, the application works by detecting the highest ROI in each image frame

# Second step
WORKING ON A SINGLE FRAME TO DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM

# Later steps
Using HOG filtering trying to find needle at the beggining, and later track her based on difference beetwen histograms of image.
